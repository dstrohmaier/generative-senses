This repository contains an implementation of some core operations from [Bradley Franks' 1995 paper "Sense Generation"](https://philpapers.org/rec/FRASGA) using Prolog. It serves to showcase how modern Prolog features can make it easy to implement cognitive-linguistic models.

The motivation and underlying theory are further discussed in [this blogpost](https://dstrohmaier.com/generative-senses/).

The code was tested on [Scryer-Prolog](https://www.scryer.pl/), but should work with minor changes on other implementations as long as they have versions of the libraries I used. If you want to try it out and have any problems, feel free to message me about it.
